# Solderable keyboard kit build guide template

Rising tides raise all ships, so I wanted to make a good place for anyone to start a build guide. Take the photos listed below and you will have the photos needed for the build guide. Mvp do a find a replace for the items below and you should have something that works.

Find and replace tags:
* ```KEYBOARDNAME```
    - this is the keyboards name : string
* ```KEYCAPSTYLE```
    - this is the style of keycaps : string (choc, mx, choc or mx)

    - this is the style of switches : string (choc, mx, choc or mx)
* ```DIODESTYLE```
    - this is the style of diodes : string (through hole, SMD, SMD or TH)
* ```CONTROLLERSTYLE```
    - this is the style of controller : string (Pro-Micro style, seeed xiao, pico)
* ```CONTROLLERPLACEMENT```
    - this is the style of controller : string (face up, face down, face up on left face down in right side)
* ```PCBCOUNT```
    - this is the number of diodes : int
* ```SWITCHCOUNT```
    - this is the number of switches : int
* ```CONTROLLERCOUNT```
