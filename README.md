# Solderable keyboard kit build guide template

Rising tides raise all ships, so I wanted to make a good place for anyone to start a build guide. Take the photos listed below and you will have the photos needed for the build guide. Mvp do a find a replace for *KEYBOARDNAME* and you should have something that works.
